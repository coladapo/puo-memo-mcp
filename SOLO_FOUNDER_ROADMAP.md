# Solo Founder Roadmap - PUO Memo 2025

## Reality Check: One Person + Claude Code

As a solo founder with Claude Code as your principal engineer, we need a completely different approach. Let's be strategic about what YOU can realistically achieve while building a sustainable business.

## Core Principle: Leverage, Automate, Outsource

### Your Superpowers as a Solo Founder
1. **Claude Code** - Your 24/7 principal engineer
2. **No meetings** - 100% execution time  
3. **Fast decisions** - No consensus needed
4. **Low burn** - No salaries to pay

### Your Constraints
1. **One person** - Can't be in multiple places
2. **Time** - Only 40-60 hours/week
3. **Expertise gaps** - Can't be expert at everything
4. **No redundancy** - You're the single point of failure

## Revised Roadmap: The Lean Path

### Phase 1: Simplified Production Launch (Weeks 1-2)
**Focus**: Get it live with minimal complexity

```bash
# Skip Kubernetes! Use managed services instead
1. Deploy to Render.com or Railway
   - Automatic SSL
   - Built-in scaling
   - Zero DevOps needed
   
2. Use Supabase for PostgreSQL
   - Managed backups
   - Built-in auth
   - Real-time subscriptions
   
3. Use Vercel for frontend
   - Automatic deployments
   - Global CDN
   - Analytics included
```

**Claude Code Tasks**:
- Create render.yaml deployment config
- Set up GitHub Actions for auto-deploy
- Configure environment variables

### Phase 2: Revenue ASAP (Weeks 3-4)
**Focus**: Get paying customers before building more features

```javascript
// Stripe Checkout - Simplest path to revenue
1. Three tiers only:
   - Hobby: $9/month (100 memories)
   - Pro: $29/month (unlimited)
   - Team: $99/month (5 users)

2. Use Stripe Checkout (no custom billing UI)
3. Manual enterprise deals via email
```

**Claude Code Tasks**:
- Integrate Stripe Checkout
- Add usage limits to API
- Create pricing page

### Phase 3: Distribution Strategy (Weeks 5-8)
**Focus**: Acquire users without building mobile apps

```markdown
1. Chrome Extension
   - Quick capture from any webpage
   - 1-week build with Claude Code
   - Instant distribution via Chrome Store

2. Telegram Bot
   - Voice notes → memories
   - No app store approval needed
   - 2-day build

3. Email Integration
   - Forward emails to save@puomemo.com
   - Zapier webhooks for everything else
```

**Claude Code Tasks**:
- Build Chrome extension
- Create Telegram bot
- Set up email ingestion

### Phase 4: The 80/20 Features (Weeks 9-12)
**Focus**: Build only what users are willing to pay for

```yaml
Must Have (80% value):
- Search that actually works
- Basic sharing (public links)
- CSV export
- API keys for developers

Nice to Have (20% value):
- AI categorization
- Mobile apps
- Enterprise SSO
- Admin dashboard
```

### Phase 5: Growth Hacks (Months 4-6)
**Focus**: Grow without a marketing budget

```markdown
1. Open Source the SDKs
   - Free marketing from GitHub stars
   - Community contributions
   - Developer credibility

2. Build in Public
   - Daily Twitter updates
   - Monthly revenue reports
   - Technical blog posts (Claude writes them!)

3. Integrations Over Features
   - Obsidian plugin
   - Notion importer
   - Slack bot
   - Make.com/Zapier templates
```

## The Solo Founder Tech Stack

### What to Use (Managed Everything)
- **Hosting**: Render.com ($7-25/month)
- **Database**: Supabase ($25/month)
- **Frontend**: Vercel ($20/month)
- **Monitoring**: BetterUptime (free)
- **Analytics**: Plausible ($9/month)
- **Email**: Resend ($20/month)
- **Support**: Crisp chat ($25/month)

**Total Infrastructure**: <$150/month

### What to Skip (For Now)
- ❌ Kubernetes
- ❌ Self-hosted monitoring
- ❌ Custom admin dashboard
- ❌ Native mobile apps
- ❌ Enterprise features
- ❌ AI features (unless they drive revenue)

## Daily Execution Plan

### Your Week (40 hours)
```
Monday (8h):    Feature development with Claude
Tuesday (8h):   Feature development with Claude  
Wednesday (8h): Customer support + Bug fixes
Thursday (8h):  Marketing/Sales activities
Friday (8h):    Planning + Infrastructure
```

### Claude Code's Week (∞ hours)
```
- Write code while you sleep
- Debug while you eat
- Test while you exercise
- Document while you relax
```

## Revenue Milestones (Realistic)

### Month 1: $0 → $500 MRR
- 10 beta users at $0
- 10 early adopters at $29
- 2 teams at $99

### Month 3: $2,500 MRR
- 50 pro users
- 10 team accounts
- 1 manual enterprise deal

### Month 6: $10,000 MRR
- 200 pro users
- 30 teams
- 5 enterprise deals

### Month 12: $30,000 MRR
- Hire first employee
- Or stay solo and profitable!

## The Unfair Advantages

### 1. Claude Code Leverage
```python
# What Claude can do while you sleep:
- Write entire features
- Create documentation
- Build integrations  
- Fix bugs
- Answer support tickets
- Write blog posts
```

### 2. No-Code Integrations
```yaml
Zapier Templates:
- Gmail → PUO Memo
- Slack → PUO Memo
- Notion → PUO Memo
- PUO Memo → Google Sheets

Make.com Scenarios:
- Voice → Transcription → PUO Memo
- Screenshot → OCR → PUO Memo
- RSS → Summary → PUO Memo
```

### 3. Community Building
```markdown
1. Open Slack/Discord (free)
2. Weekly office hours (build loyalty)
3. User-generated templates
4. Referral rewards (free months)
```

## What Success Looks Like

### Option A: Lifestyle Business
- $30K MRR = $360K/year
- Stay solo + Claude Code
- 20-hour work weeks
- Travel while working

### Option B: Venture Scale
- $30K MRR = Seed funding
- Hire team with investment
- Delegate to focus on growth
- Aim for $1M ARR

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### Day 1-2: Deploy to Render
```bash
# Claude Code will:
1. Create render.yaml
2. Set up auto-deploy
3. Configure environment
4. Deploy API + Frontend
```

### Day 3-4: Add Stripe
```bash
# Claude Code will:
1. Create checkout sessions
2. Add webhook handlers
3. Implement usage limits
4. Create pricing page
```

### Day 5-7: First Customers
```bash
# You will:
1. Post on Twitter/X
2. Share on Indie Hackers
3. Submit to directories
4. Email your network
```

## The Mental Model

### Build → Sell → Build
1. Build minimum viable feature
2. Sell it to 10 people
3. Only then build the next feature

### Your Job vs Claude's Job
- **You**: Vision, customers, sales
- **Claude**: Code, debug, document

### Say No To
- Feature requests from non-paying users
- Complexity that doesn't drive revenue  
- Perfectionism over shipping
- Building for "someday" scale

## Reality Check Reminders

1. **Your first 100 customers are EVERYTHING**
   - Talk to them weekly
   - Build what they'll pay for
   - Ignore everyone else

2. **Revenue solves all problems**
   - Runway = infinite with profit
   - Hiring = possible with revenue
   - Features = justified by payment

3. **You can always add complexity later**
   - Start simple
   - Grow with revenue
   - Hire when painful

## The First 30 Days

Week 1: Deploy + Basic Billing
Week 2: Chrome Extension + First Sales  
Week 3: Customer Feedback + Iterations
Week 4: Growth Experiments + Metrics

**Target**: 10 paying customers by Day 30

## Your Competitive Advantage

It's not the features. It's:
1. **Speed** - Ship daily with Claude
2. **Focus** - No committee decisions
3. **Direct** - You answer every email
4. **Flexible** - Pivot in minutes

## Final Thought

Notion started with one person.
Gumroad is still mostly one person.
Plausible Analytics: 2 people, $1M ARR.

You + Claude Code = Small team equivalent

**Ship fast. Charge early. Stay lean.**
