# Supabase Migration Summary

## Migration Status: 90% Complete

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Configuration Updates**
   - Updated `.env` file with Supabase credentials
   - Updated `claude_desktop_config.json` with Supabase host/port
   - Updated `cursor_mcp_settings.json` with Supabase credentials
   - Fixed pgbouncer compatibility by adding `statement_cache_size: 0`

2. **Database Connection**
   - Successfully connected to Supabase PostgreSQL
   - Verified 644 memories exist in Supabase (including 630 migrated)
   - Fixed pgbouncer prepared statement errors in `database.py`

3. **Source Code Updates**
   - Updated Symphony MCP's PuoMemoAdapter.ts with Supabase credentials
   - Modified database.py to disable prepared statements for pgbouncer

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending Tasks

1. **Symphony MCP Rebuild**
   - Run: `cd /Users/wivak/puo-jects/active/cos\ mcp/mental\ models/symphony-mcp && npm run build`
   - This will apply the Supabase configuration changes

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test memory creation from ChatGPT
   - Test memory creation from Cursor
   - Verify cross-source memory correlation

### üìã Configuration Details

**Supabase Connection:**
```
Host: aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com
Port: 6543
Database: postgres
User: postgres.bcmsutoahlxqriealrjb
Password: 8b6ppMV2F03xNyIy
```

**Important:** Always use `statement_cache_size: 0` when connecting through pgbouncer.

### üîß Fixed Issues

1. **Claude Desktop Wrong Host**: Was using direct connection instead of pooler
2. **Symphony MCP Hardcoded Credentials**: Was using old Google Cloud credentials
3. **Pgbouncer Prepared Statements**: Added `statement_cache_size: 0` to fix compatibility

### üìù Next Steps

1. Run `./complete_migration.sh` to finish the migration
2. Restart Claude Desktop after Symphony MCP rebuild
3. Test memory creation from all sources
4. Monitor for any connection issues

### üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] All MCPs connect to Supabase successfully
- [ ] Memories from ChatGPT, Claude, and Cursor flow to Supabase
- [ ] No database connection errors
- [ ] Access to all 630+ migrated memories
- [ ] Cross-source memory correlation works

### üö® Troubleshooting

If you encounter pgbouncer errors:
- Ensure `statement_cache_size: 0` is set in all database connections
- Use the pooler endpoint (port 6543) not direct connection (port 5432)

If memories don't appear:
- Check the source_platform field to identify which source is failing
- Verify the MCP process is running with correct environment variables
- Check logs for connection errors
