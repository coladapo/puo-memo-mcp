"Tired of your AI forgetting everything between conversations? PUO Memo is the missing infrastructure piece.

✅ Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, any MCP-compatible tool

### 🧠 For AI/ML Community (Twitter/X, LinkedIn)

**Hook**: "We built the persistent memory layer the AI ecosystem was missing"

"Every AI conversation starts from zero. That's not intelligence - that's digital amnesia.

PUO Memo provides:
🧠 Universal memory across all AI tools
🔍 Semantic search powered by embeddings
🌐 Model Context Protocol integration
📈 Scales from prototype to production

The infrastructure play everyone's been waiting for."

### 🛠️ For MCP Ecosystem (Discord, GitHub Discussions)

**Hook**: "New MCP server for persistent memory"

**Message**:
"Hey MCP community! 👋

Just released puo-memo-mcp - adds persistent memory to any MCP-compatible AI assistant.

Features:
- Store/retrieve memories with natural language
- Automatic entity extraction and tagging  
- Cross-conversation context retention
- TypeScript SDK with full type definitions

Perfect companion to existing MCP tools like Tavily (search) and Context7 (docs).

Would love feedback from the community!"

**Call to Action**: "Check it out and let me know what you think"

### 🏢 For Business/Enterprise (LinkedIn, Industry Forums)

**Hook**: "AI memory infrastructure for teams"

**Message**:
"Enterprise AI deployments face a critical problem: context loss.

Every conversation starts from scratch. Teams lose institutional knowledge. AI assistants can't learn from previous interactions.

PUO Memo solves this with enterprise-grade memory infrastructure:
📊 Team knowledge bases
🔒 SOC 2 Type II compliance  
⚡ 99.9% uptime SLA
🔧 API-first architecture

Stop rebuilding context. Start building on memory."

**Call to Action**: "Book enterprise demo"

## Launch Sequence Strategy

## Key Messages to Avoid

❌ "Better than competitors" - Position as complementary
❌ "Disruptive" - Be the helpful newcomer
❌ "Complex enterprise features" - Keep initial messaging simple
❌ "AI replacement" - Position as AI enhancement

## Success Metrics by Channel

- **Developer Forums**: Comments, upvotes, trial signups
- **Social Media**: Shares, follows, website clicks

- **Business**: Demo requests, enterprise inquiries

## Tone Guidelines

- **Confident but humble** - We solve a real problem without overhyping
- **Technical but accessible** - Deep enough for developers, clear for everyone
- **Community-focused** - We're building together, not selling to
- **Value-driven** - Always lead with user benefit, not features
