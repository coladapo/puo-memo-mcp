# IP Protection & Licensing Model

## For Our Existing Users

**Nothing changes for you!** This document simply clarifies what has always been true about Purmemo's architecture. Your MCP integration continues to work exactly as before.

## Understanding Purmemo's Hybrid Model

Purmemo operates on a hybrid open-core model, similar to successful companies like GitLab, Elastic, and Docker.

### What's Open Source (This Repository)

âœ… **You can freely:**
- Use the MCP server
- Modify it for your needs
- Contribute improvements
- Build integrations
- Fork and distribute

**This includes:**
- Complete MCP protocol implementation
- OAuth 2.1 authentication flow
- All 5 tool interfaces
- API client wrapper
- Full documentation

### What's Proprietary (Purmemo's Core)

ðŸ”’ **Protected innovations:**
- 94% accuracy memory algorithms
- AI-powered entity extraction
- Sub-50ms retrieval optimization
- Workflow intelligence engine
- Consciousness gradient system

**Why this matters:** These innovations took years to develop and are what make Purmemo uniquely valuable. Protecting them ensures we can continue improving the service for you.

## The "Coca-Cola" Model

Think of it like Coca-Cola:
- **The bottle** (MCP interface) = Open standard
- **The formula** (our algorithms) = Trade secret

You get a standard bottle that works everywhere, filled with our special formula.

## Benefits for Users

### You Get Best of Both Worlds

1. **Open Protocol** = No vendor lock-in
2. **Protected Innovation** = Continued excellence
3. **Community Driven** = Everyone can contribute
4. **Sustainable Business** = Long-term support

### Your Rights

âœ… **You can:**
- Use Purmemo MCP commercially
- Modify the MCP server
- Create custom integrations
- Switch to alternatives anytime
- Export all your data

âœ… **We provide:**
- Continuous improvements
- Security updates
- New features
- Professional support
- API stability

## Industry Examples

Many successful projects use this model:

| Company | Open Source | Proprietary |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| GitLab | Core platform | Enterprise features |
| Docker | Container runtime | Docker Hub, Enterprise |
| Elastic | Elasticsearch basics | Cloud features, ML |
| MongoDB | Database core | Atlas cloud service |
| **Purmemo** | MCP server | Memory algorithms |

## FAQ

### Q: Can I self-host everything?
**A:** The MCP server runs locally. The memory engine requires our API, but enterprise customers can discuss self-hosted options.

### Q: Will the MCP server always be open source?
**A:** Yes! The MCP protocol implementation will remain MIT licensed.

### Q: Can I build a competing service?
**A:** You can use the MCP server, but our algorithms and optimizations are protected by trade secrets and pending patents.

### Q: What if Purmemo shuts down?
**A:** Your MCP server still works. We also provide data export guarantees and have contingency plans for service continuity.

## Patents & Trade Secrets

We are pursuing patents for specific innovations:
- Memory breeding algorithm
- Consciousness gradient system
- Workflow intelligence detection
- Cross-platform handoff generation

These patents protect our R&D investment while keeping the protocol open.

## Commitment to Open Source

We commit to:
- âœ… Keeping the MCP server MIT licensed
- âœ… Accepting community contributions
- âœ… Maintaining backward compatibility
- âœ… Transparent communication
- âœ… Supporting the MCP ecosystem
