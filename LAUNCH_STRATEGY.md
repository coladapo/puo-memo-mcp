# PUO Memo MCP Launch Strategy

## Strategic Context

This is not just an npm publish - it's PUO Memo's introduction to the global developer ecosystem. The MCP ecosystem is nascent but growing rapidly. We have a first-mover advantage window.

## NPM Publishing Strategy

### Keywords Optimization
- `mcp` - Primary discovery term
- `model-context-protocol` - Technical accuracy
- `ai` - Broad appeal
- `memory` - Core value prop
- `claude` - Major use case
- `chatgpt` - Broad appeal
- `cursor` - Developer tool integration
- `knowledge-management` - Enterprise appeal

### Description Strategy
"Open source MCP client for PUO Memo - Universal memory system for AI assistants"

This positions us as:
1. **Open source** - Builds trust
2. **Universal** - Not tied to one AI tool
3. **Memory system** - Clear value prop
4. **For AI assistants** - Clear use case

### Version Strategy
- Start at 0.1.0 - Signals early but stable
- Semantic versioning for predictable updates
- Clear changelog for transparency

1. npm publish (establish presence)
2. GitHub repository (community hub)
3. Documentation site (professional presence)
4. Community announcements (drive adoption)

## Success Metrics
