🧠 Just launched PUO Memo - the missing memory layer for AI assistants

Every AI conversation starts from zero. That's not intelligence, that's digital amnesia.

Now your Claude/ChatGPT/Cursor can remember everything across conversations 🧵

**Tweet 2:**  
✅ 2-minute setup: `npm install -g puo-memo-mcp`
✅ Works with any MCP-compatible AI tool
✅ Open source client + scalable platform
✅ Free tier to get started

Think "Stripe for AI memory"

**Tweet 3:**
The infrastructure play the AI ecosystem needed:
🔍 Semantic search across all memories

**Title:** Finally solved the AI memory problem - PUO Memo MCP client

**Post:**
Hey r/LocalLLaMA! 👋

Been lurking here for months watching everyone struggle with the same problem: AI assistants that forget everything between conversations.

Finally built something to fix this - **PUO Memo**.

**What it does:**
- Gives your AI perfect memory across all conversations
- Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, any MCP-compatible tool  
- Stores memories with natural language search
- Automatic entity extraction (remembers people, projects, etc.)

**Why you'll like it:**
- Open source client (MIT license)
- 2-minute setup: `npm install -g puo-memo-mcp`
- Free tier to get started
- Actually works (TypeScript, proper error handling)

**Technical details:**
- Model Context Protocol integration
- REST API with robust retry logic
- Anonymous telemetry (opt-out available)
- Self-hosting guide included

Think of it as the infrastructure layer the AI ecosystem was missing. You focus on building cool stuff, we handle the memory.

**Links:**
- Try free: https://puo-memo.com  
- Open source: https://github.com/puo-memo/puo-memo-mcp
- npm: https://npmjs.com/package/puo-memo-mcp

Happy to answer questions! Built this because I was frustrated by the same memory loss you all complain about.

## 💬 Discord MCP Community

**Message:**
Hey MCP community! 👋

Just released a new MCP server that adds persistent memory to AI assistants: **puo-memo-mcp**

**Features:**
🧠 Store/retrieve memories with natural language
🔍 Semantic search across all stored information  
🏷️ Automatic entity extraction and tagging
💾 Cross-conversation context retention
📝 Full TypeScript support with type definitions

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install -g puo-memo-mcp
```

**Config for Claude Desktop:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "puo-memo": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["puo-memo-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PUO_MEMO_API_KEY": "your-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Perfect companion to existing tools like Tavily (search) and Context7 (docs). Now your AI can actually remember things!

Would love feedback from the community. What features would be most valuable?

## 🔶 Hacker News

**Title:** PUO Memo – Open source persistent memory for AI assistants

**Submission text:**
Built this because I was tired of my AI forgetting everything between conversations. PUO Memo provides persistent memory that works across Claude Desktop, Cursor, and any MCP-compatible tool.

The client is open source (MIT), connects to a hosted platform via API. Think Stripe's model - you get the SDK, we handle the infrastructure.

Technical highlights:
- Model Context Protocol integration  
- TypeScript with full type definitions
- Semantic search via embeddings
- 27kB npm package, zero dependencies in browser
- Self-hosting guide included

Two-minute setup: `npm install -g puo-memo-mcp`

This feels like the missing infrastructure piece for the AI ecosystem. Would love HN's feedback on the approach.

## 📱 LinkedIn Post

🧠 **Just launched PUO Memo - solving AI's memory problem**

Every enterprise AI deployment faces the same challenge: context loss.

Teams lose institutional knowledge. AI assistants can't learn from previous interactions. Every conversation starts from scratch.

**We built the infrastructure layer to fix this:**

✅ Persistent memory across all AI tools
✅ Team knowledge bases with semantic search  
✅ Enterprise-grade security (SOC 2 Type II)
✅ API-first architecture for custom integrations

The client is open source, the platform scales globally. Think Stripe for AI memory.

**Early results:**
• 2-minute setup time
• Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, any MCP tool
• Free tier for individual developers
• Enterprise features for teams

This is the missing piece that transforms AI from helpful tool to institutional knowledge system.
