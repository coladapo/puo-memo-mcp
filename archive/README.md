# üì¶ Archive - Development History

This archive contains all the servers and tests created during the development of the ultimate Purmemo MCP solution. These files are preserved for historical reference and learning.

## üóÑÔ∏è Archived Servers

### Development Timeline

1. **enhanced-server.js** (Archived)
   - 8 specialized tools - too complex
   - Problem: Claude confused by too many tools
   - Learning: Simplicity is key

2. **smart-server.js** (Archived)
   - 3 tools with auto-extraction
   - Good idea but still captured summaries
   - Learning: Need to force Claude to send content

3. **prompted-server.js** (Archived)
   - Aggressive prompting approach
   - Partial success, validation worked
   - Learning: Prompting helps but hits size limits

4. **chunked-server.js** (Archived)
   - Pure chunking implementation
   - Solved 100K capture problem
   - Learning: Chunking is essential for large content

5. **server.js** (Archived)
   - Original basic implementation
   - Kept as historical reference
   - Learning: Starting point of journey

## üèÜ Production Solution

**ultimate-server.js** - Deployed as production
- Combines all learnings
- 4 comprehensive tools
- Auto-chunking for large content
- 71% test pass rate verified

## üìù Why These Were Archived

Each server taught us something crucial:
- **Too Complex**: enhanced-server.js showed tool proliferation is bad
- **Missing Validation**: smart-server.js lacked content enforcement
- **Size Limits**: prompted-server.js hit Claude's generation limit
- **Single Purpose**: chunked-server.js only solved one problem

The ultimate server combines all these lessons into one comprehensive solution.

## üîç Accessing Archive

These files are preserved but not active. To reference:
```bash
# View an archived server
cat archive/servers/[filename]

# Compare with production
diff archive/servers/smart-server.js src/ultimate-server.js
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT USE ARCHIVED SERVERS

These servers are incomplete solutions. Always use:
- **Production**: `src/ultimate-server.js`
- **Documentation**: `COMPREHENSIVE_SOLUTION.md`
